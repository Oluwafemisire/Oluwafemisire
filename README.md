I am **Oluwafemisire**, a Computer Science major at Kibo School of Technology. I am also an aspiring Software Engineer and an avid learner. Python is my language of choice, but C is the language that birth my love for computer science.

I am interested in financial technological services and I am open to learning. I am currently working on a building a web application that helps people navigate mental health problems. I am hoping to contribute a lot more this year.

### Proud Moment

#### Assignment Tracker 
A team mate and I developed a web application that helps students track their assignment deadlines. This assignment tracker helps students stay organized and on top of their game with a hectic workload.

[This is the demo for the assignment tracker](https://assignment-tracker-pccx.onrender.com/)

### Student Enrollment Manager
This is a CRUD python CLI app that helps enroll students in a program. The app also manages courses available in the program. I implement data persistence with list.
